                                <p>	The last year has been like no other. <br />Twelve months ago, when we left our classes, we didn’t know that we wouldn’t be returning.
                                    The halls of our classes, the places we studied, partied and made memories — those places are empty. We’ve been spaced out, distanced and masked.  </p>
                                <p> 	While the word ‘unprecedented’ may feel overused, the effects of COVID-19 have brought with it a litany of
                                    seemingly unanswerable questions. What does it mean to be safe? What does it mean to be connected? Who is essential?</p>
                                <p> 	Frankly, this year has given us more time to reflect on the truths that we hold to be self-evident, not just for ourselves but the systems that we live in.
                                    But as we’ve held these truths up to a microscope for further examination, it hasn’t been pretty. There are more than just a few glitches in our system. </p>
                                <p>This magazine will attempt to locate the bugs and attempt to answer the unanswerable. We’ll go back to the past,
                                    take an uncomfortable seat in the present and even discuss what we need to create a better future. </p>
                                <p> Creating systemic change is never easy. But in a year like this one, where we’ve all been affected and need a break from being online... maybe it’s a system reboot that’s required.</p>
