    title: "A Message from the Editor",
    paragraphs: [`While the title of this year’s magazine is more than a little tongue-in-cheek, the subject matter is serious.
    The climate crisis is quickly becoming one of the defining issues of our time, and its importance will only continue to grow as its impacts become more severe and are felt in more places. It is a problem that political scientists love to call “super wicked” and that’s how it feels so much of the time, like something so big and complex that there’s nothing we as individuals can do. We think that’s part of where our tendency to make light of it comes from. When we joke about something it gives us a semblance of control.
    We hope that by seeing a different side of the crisis and hearing about the ways — big and small — that people and institutions are trying to make change, you will be inspired to act, whether that means changing your consumption or just signing a petition.
    Because at the end of the day, no matter how cheeky our discussion of the crisis is, it is here and happening now. And even if you’re not a policy-maker or a politician, we all need to have our eyes wide open when it comes to where our planet is headed.`]
