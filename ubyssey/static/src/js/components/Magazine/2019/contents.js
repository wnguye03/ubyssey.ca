  title: "A Message from the Editor",
  paragraphs: [`We are a campus of over 60,000 people, all with different stories, backgrounds, trials and tribulations.
  How does UBC support or hinder those differences? How do we — as individuals, departments and
  communities at a university — claim our own space? How do we continue to evolve and grow when the campus
  around us seems not to fit us? How do we stand up for our beliefs? How do we continue to be us and
  celebrate our diversity?`, `In this year’s Ubyssey magazine, we opened the doors to the various cultures, stories, ways of life and
  perspectives that make UBC the unique place it is today — and discussed how we make our presence known
  on campus, be that through reclaiming and fighting for our space, holding our own or beginning to
  include ourselves in the folds of UBC’s tapestry.`, `Thank you to all who helped write, illustrate, edit, produce and imagine the possibilities for this
  magazine. You’ve created the beautiful building blocks for a little haven of support and celebration
  within these pages and I am so proud of the work that you have produced. For those who shared your
  stories, thank you for your courage, honesty and openness.`, `This magazine is just the beginning of all the incredible stories waiting to be told on our campus about how students, staff and faculty have shaped and continue to shape our university identity.`, `We hope it acts as a stepping stone for you to share yours.`]
